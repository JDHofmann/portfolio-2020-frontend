            <p>I am a web developer who loves creating things from scratch and bringing them to life. User experience is important to me, so I strive to optimize productsâ€™ functionality, while crafting the most meaningful and effective environment possible. I believe that things should not only look beautiful on the outside, but also function beautifully under the hood as well.</p>
