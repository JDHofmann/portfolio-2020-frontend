            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I’m JD, a full stack developer, UI/UX specialist, musician and builder of things.</p>
            <p>I am a web developer who loves creating things from scratch and bringing them to life. User experience is important to me, so I strive to optimize products’ functionality, while crafting the most meaningful and effective environment possible. I believe that things should not only look beautiful on the outside, but also function beautifully under the hood as well.</p>
            <p>I spent fifteen years as a professional musician, both producing music for artists and composing my own work. Creativity is my life’s work and what continually drives me. When I’m not coding, you can find me building furniture, cooking ambitious meals, and continuing to compose music.</p>
